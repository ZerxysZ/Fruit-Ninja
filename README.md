# Fruit Ninja

Fruit Ninja is a Python game created by @ZerxysZ. This project represents my first major Python endeavor, which I dedicated a significant amount of time and effort to throughout the semester. It surpasses my previous projects in terms of commitment and serves as a source of pride for me. I may even look back at it in the future to admire my work.
